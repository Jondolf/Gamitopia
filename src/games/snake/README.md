# Snake

Snake is a classic game where you move a snake up, down, left or right and try to gather as many fruit as you can whilst trying to avoid hitting walls or slithering into your own tail. As you get more fruit, your tail grows longer making it more and more difficult to get around without hitting your own tail.\
Your goal is to get as many fruit as you can. If you hit a wall or your own tail, the snake dies and you will have to try again.

In the settings of the game you can change the size of the board/game area, the speed of your snake, turn on fullscreen and more.

The game works with a keyboard (WASD or arrow keys) or with a touch screen (swipe to change direction).
