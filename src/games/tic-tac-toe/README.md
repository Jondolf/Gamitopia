# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe or Noughts and Crosses is a classic game where you put crosses (X's) or noughts (O's) onto a grid, traditionally a 3x3 grid.

## Instructions

Before starting the game, the two players decide who uses crosses (X's) and who uses noughts (O's).

On a 3x3 grid your goal is to get 3 crosses/noughts in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row. Whenever a player puts down a cross or a nought the turn switches and the other player gets to put down a cross or a nought.\
The player that succeeds wins the game. If all squares on the grid are filled and no-one has gotten a row of 3, the game will be a tie.

For more information about the rules check out the instructions in the game itself.

Currently you can only play the game locally against someone else.
