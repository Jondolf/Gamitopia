# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe or Noughts and Crosses is a classic game where you put crosses (X's) or noughts (O's) onto a grid, traditionally a 3x3 grid.

## Instructions

One player will use crosses (X's) and the other will use noughts (O's).

By default, your goal is to get 3 crosses/noughts in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row. Whenever a player puts down a cross or a nought the turn switches and the other player gets to put down a cross or a nought.\
The player that succeeds first wins the game. If all squares on the grid are filled and no-one has won the game yet, the game will be a tie.

For more information about the rules check out the instructions in the game itself.

You can play the game locally against someone else or against an AI.
