Calculator also has a separate GitHub repository, which you can find **[here](https://github.com/Jondolf/Calculator)**

### The full version [(the Android app version)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamitopia.calculator)
The full version has a calculator, many unit converters (including a currency converter), a tool for creating beautiful charts, a graphing calculator and more.
The app has many color themes and customization options, so you can make the app your own.

### The web version (this version)
The web version of Calculator only has the calculator and no customization.
The web version is made with Vue and the app version is made with Ionic Angular, so it would be difficult to keep them both updated.`,

As you get more fruit, your tail grows longer making it more and more difficult to get around without hitting your own tail.
Your goal is to get as many fruit as you can. If you hit a wall or your own tail, the snake dies and you will have to try again.

In the settings of the game you can change the size of the board/game area, the speed of your snake, turn on fullscreen and more.

The game works with a keyboard (WASD or arrow keys) or with a touch screen (swipe to change direction).`,

        `Tic-Tac-Toe or Noughts and Crosses is a classic game where you put crosses (X's) or noughts (O's) onto a grid, traditionally a 3x3 grid.

### Instructions
Before starting the game, the two players decide who uses crosses (X's) and who uses noughts (O's).
On a 3x3 grid your goal is to get 3 crosses/noughts in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row. Whenever a player puts down a cross or a nought the turn switches and the other player gets to put down a cross or a nought.
The player that succeeds wins the game. If all squares on the grid are filled and no-one has gotten a row of 3, the game will be a tie.

For more information about the rules check out the instructions in the game itself.

Currently you can only play the game locally against someone else.`,

#### Number Range
Get a random number from 0 to 10 (with default settings).
You can move the slider below the randomizer button to change the range of numbers to randomize,
for example 0 to 100 or 0 to 255.  

#### Heads or Tails
Throw a coin to get either heads or tails. This could be useful if you have to decide between two things.
For example, should I eat pizza or lasagna? Heads or tails?

#### Roll Dice
Get a random number (shown on the dice) between 1 and 6. This could be useful, for example,
if you want to play board games but don't have a dice with you.`,
